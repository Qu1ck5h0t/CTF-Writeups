## I actually reinstalled Terraria just to solve this challenge, but turns out [my world file was broken when I went to the coordinates](https://ibb.co/q2nzyJz) and I had to get a new copy from the organisers.

I was given a world map for this challenge. 
When I opened it in TEdit, I noticed that there were a lot of decorations, including paintings on the map. Following that, I started thinking for a connection between the title and the game and I found out that there's a painting in the game called [Waldo](https://terraria-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Waldo).

I took the ID from that wiki page and searched for the item on the map.

TEdit found the painting in a granite cave, and I noticed that there was a granite chest right next to it. I looked in the chest and saw an item called "Massive Fart in a Jar". Very amusing.

(red boxes added for clarity)

Following the flag format in an example in the title, I got
```
ectf{Massive_Fart_in_a_Jar}
```


Postscript: The book's correct name should be "Where's Wally" due to the author being British, and the character named "Wally" in commonwealth countries. I have messaged the organisers to correct this oversight.
