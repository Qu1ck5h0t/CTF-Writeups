## This one took me a bit to get, but the solution was really satisfying.

At first I thought it was some sort of cipher or encoding, but it didn't look like any of the ones I know, so I was a bit stumped. I also noticed that the first character was a } despite the fact that it should be the last. My first instinct was to reverse it but that didn't work either.

Then I saw that starting from the second letter in the ciphertext, "ectf{" string can be spelled by putting together every other letter. I started writing the pattern down on a piece of paper.

When I reached the end, I started putting together every other letter from right to left, following the first part.

##### Visualisation of my thought process. Start from left to right with red, then right to left with blue.
