# This was one of the first challs I did and was pretty simple. Overall a good warmup to what came afterwards.

When I connected to the instance, I was faced with three consecutive hashes, with the algorithms being MD5, SHA1 and SHA256PLAIN respectively. Before I tried using a hash cracker like johntheripper or hashcat, I first went with an [online hash cracking website](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash) to see if it would save me some time, in case the hashes were weak passwords. Turns out that was indeed the case, so hurray for me I guess.
