# I got first blood on this challenge, which I'm very proud of.

The image in this challenge is also a panorama. Unlike the previous chall, there does not appear to be a distinct building or area of interest.

However, the red building seemed to be the best candidate with its rock foundation and red door. Given these distinct attributes, I screenshotted that part of the image and did a reverse image search on it.

One of the first results is a [wikimedia commons page](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lore_City_UMC.jpg), where it was revealed that the building was actually a church. All I had to do from there was find the name of the street that the church is located, which took very little time.

```UMDCTF{Main St, Lore City, OH 43755}```


Postscript: I wish to reiterate that I was the first competitor to solve this challenge. Not that there's any practical purpose in me doing so, but I am very quite proud of my accomplishment despite its relative insignificance.
