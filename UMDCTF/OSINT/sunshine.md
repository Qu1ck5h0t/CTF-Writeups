# This is the third chall I solved, not much to say about it except that I did NOT expect Lebron to be an Ohioian.

From the panorama, we can see a bunch of houses. Given that the challenge asked for the address of house number 356, it'd be safe to assume that that specific house probably carries some significance. Under that assumption, I reverse image searched the house I found with "356" on it.

I was quite surprised to find that this was actually Lebron James' childhood home, and after a few more searches I found the full address.
