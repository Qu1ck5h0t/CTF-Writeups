# This is the only CTF chall I've ever seen that involves social engineering, which is pretty cool. However it's DEFINITELY not my proudest solution. At least the organisers all liked it a lot though.

After reading the desc, the first thing I tried to do was to find some source of personal info from him on the internet. I didn't find anything except a link to a guy with the same name and same location, but at a paid website.

The authors advised strongly against using that paid website, but I kept note of the age I found as if it is actually the author (which it likely is), I would know the possible years of birth.

The degree on his Linkedin profile seems to support this evidence, as it shows that he started university in 2019 while students in the US generally start university at 18. Thus, it is safe to assume that he was born in 2001.

With nowhere else to go, I reexamined the description and noticed that it stated that social engineering is not off the table. Then I knew what I had to do.

I asked a friend of mine for one of her 50 Discord alt accounts, and approached him as a "girl" in an attempt to get him to simp into giving me more info on his birthday. After some talk that I would really not want to post here in consideration of my digital footstep, I got the following crucial information:

This tells me that it is highly likely that his month of birth is April. However I still needed his day of birth, so I tried to get him to give it to me indirectly through his "rapper name".

I didn't get a response and I got quite impatient, so I decided to try to guess his day of birth as there were only 18 days left of the month. I got lucky on 9th input.

```texsaw{25/04/2001}```

Postscript: After finding the solution I made sure to let him know I'm grateful for giving me the info I needed.

And in a later DM from my main account, I learnt that it was pretty well received
