In order to find more information on the author I decided to look up his Linkedin username on Google, as people tend to use the same usernames across platforms. I ended up finding [his website](https://nisimmons.github.io/) where he has his phone number listed, as shown below.

By putting his phone number into the format, I got the flag. The whole thing took me less than 5 minutes, which is pretty surprising given its lower solve rate in comparison to the two other more difficult challs of its trilogy.

Postscript: Nate let me know if you want me to take this down. I trust your judgement in having over 400 teams of hackers look for your phone number as part of the CTF, even though I wouldn't do it myself.
