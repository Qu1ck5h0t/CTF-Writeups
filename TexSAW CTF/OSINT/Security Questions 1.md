# This was a rather unconventional OSINT chall, as I had never seen any challenge author have CTF competitors to quite literally dox them.

I had no idea who this hotcakes guy is, so the first thing I did was to find any info I could on him as a start. By looking up his username in the Discord server, I found him to have the nickname "Nate". My next step was to ask the staff whether all the challenge authors are students from UT Dallas, as TexSAW is held by the university. From their response (screenshots unavailable), I found out that not only are the authors all UT Dallas students, but they're also mostly CS/IT majors. 

I knew that university students in CS/IT tend to be very career inclined, so I looked up people called "Nate" at the UT Dallas on Linkedin. The only search result for an undergraduate "Nate" amongst all the people in suits and jobs is a guy called Nathaniel Simmons, as shown below

Entering his name in the flag, I got the answer correct.

```texsaw{Nathaniel Simmons}```

Postscript: This is likely one of the least ethical CTF challs I've done, even though I have full authorisation from the target. Don't try this at home.
