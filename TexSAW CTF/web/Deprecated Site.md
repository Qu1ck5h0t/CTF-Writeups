The description says to somehow delete this old and deprecated site. When accessing it, there's not much there and I didn't find anything that could be exploited to give me some sort of privilege to delete the site. Then, I remembered that DELETE requests exist, so I thought I'd give it a shot and I got the flag in response to sending the request.
